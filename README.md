# Route_Planner
A simple single-file Route Planner web app for managing daily travel schedules from Monday to Saturday. Users can add places in order, mark them completed with a dim effect, clear all routes per day, and adjust text size with zoom. All data is saved automatically using localStorage for easy weekly planning.
